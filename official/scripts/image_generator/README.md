# How to Use

Ok, for the images we want to generate we must do it like so:

python3 scriptName 7 1 1900 **quantity**

Seven is the number of pixels on the size of the image, 1 is the number of boxes inside the same image and 1900 seems to be the size of the image. The **quantity** is the quantity of images we want to have in there.
